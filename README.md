# Project Description

This is my resolution of the exercise I was asked to do after the job interview.

It's a simple application with a list of airports, where we can create new airports, listing them, updating their data and deleting them from the list (CRUD operations.)

This project was developed using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) in [Vite](https://vite.dev/config/).
